# Instructions for Inputing Data
Welcome to Accounting Helper!

This app allows you to make a chart of accounts, trial balance, and income statement with a simple input of your assets, liabilities, and owner's equity.

When you first run the program, type 'assets', 'liabilities', 'capital', 'drawings', 'revenue', or 'expenses' to select the type of account that you would like to input. You will be asked to enter the name of the account, the value of the account, and whether the value is a debit or a credit.

When entering accounts receivables (debtors), please enter them in the form of 'a/r company name'. If the debtor is a person, please enter the account in the following format: 'a/r lastname;firstname'. When entering accounts payables (creditors), please enter them in the form of 'a/p company name'. If the creditor is a person, please enter the account in the following format: 'a/p lastname;firstname'. For capital accounts, enter the accounts in the following format: 'lastname;firstname, capital' or 'lastname;firstinitial., capital'. The format for entering drawings accounts is the same as for capital accounts except replace 'capital' with 'drawings'.

NOTE: The program will sort your assets in order of liquidity. Liabilities will be sorted in the order in which they should be paid. Capital and Drawings accounts will be sorted in alphabetical order by last name. Revenue and expenses will be sorted in alphabetical order. When entering the values of your accounts, do not enter the currency along with the value.

Reminder: Assets normally have a debit balance. In other words, if you have $100 in your bank account, the account balance should be debit $100. If you have a bank balance of -$100, the account balance should be credit $100. PLEASE DO NOT USE NEGATIVES. Liabilities normally have a credit balance. If you owe someone $10, the balance would be credit $10. Capital accounts and revenue normally have a credit balance. Drawings and expenses normally have debit balance.
